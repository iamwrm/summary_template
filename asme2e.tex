The ASME reference format is defined in the authors kit provided by the ASME.  The format is:


The references must appear in the paper in the order that they were cited.  In addition, multiple citations (3 or more in the same brackets) must appear as a `` [1-3]''.  A complete definition of the ASME reference format can be found in the  ASME manual \cite{asmemanual}.

The bibliography style required by the ASME is unsorted with entries appearing in the order in which the citations appear. If that were the only specification, the standard {\sc Bib}\TeX\ unsrt bibliography style could be used. Unfortunately, the bibliography style required by the ASME has additional requirements (last name followed by first name, periodical volume in boldface, periodical number inside parentheses, etc.) that are not part of the unsrt style. Therefore, to get ASME bibliography formatting, you must use the \verb+asmems4.bst+ bibliography style file with {\sc Bib}\TeX. This file is not part of the standard BibTeX distribution so you'll need to place the file someplace where LaTeX can find it (one possibility is in the same location as the file being typeset).

With \LaTeX/{\sc Bib}\TeX, \LaTeX\ uses the citation format set by the class file and writes the citation information into the .aux file associated with the \LaTeX\ source. {\sc Bib}\TeX\ reads the .aux file and matches the citations to the entries in the bibliographic data base file specified in the \LaTeX\ source file by the \verb+\bibliography+ command. {\sc Bib}\TeX\ then writes the bibliography in accordance with the rules in the bibliography .bst style file to a .bbl file which \LaTeX\ merges with the source text.  A good description of the use of {\sc Bib}\TeX\ can be found in \cite{latex, goosens} (see how 2 references are handled?).  The following is an example of how three or more references \cite{latex, asmemanual,  goosens} show up using the \verb+asmems4.bst+ bibliography style file in conjunction with the \verb+asme2e.cls+ class file. Here are some more \cite{art, blt, ibk, icn, ips, mts, mis, pro, pts, trt, upd} which can be used to describe almost any sort of reference.

% Here's where you specify the bibliography style file.
% The full file name for the bibliography style file 
% used for an ASME paper is asmems4.bst.
\bibliographystyle{asmems4}
