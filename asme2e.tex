Summary
\end{center}


In the article, Butterfield \cite{but} states that engineers support the modern
society to function well by ensuring its fundamental facilities. 
The author demonstrates his thesis through three strands considering
infrastructure or the society, which are ``connect'', ``supply'' and
``protect''. 
By designing and building infrastructure, engineers influence the society on
various levels, from small family unit to the whole globe.  


% Connect
For the first trand ``Connect'', Butterfield claims that engineers bind
communities together through transport infrastructure and telecommunication
technology. The author asserts his view on transport infrastructure by giving
the evidence about expressway, railway and areoplane which garantee people's
ability to travel wherever they want and reduce the time wasted. Engineers also
improve the reliably of consumables distribution, contibuting significantly to
the society's stable functioning. The modern telecommunication technology such
as 4G networks make people able to share their ideas with others faster,
resolving the distance gap.
