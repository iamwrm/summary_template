Summary
\end{center}


In the article, Butterfield \cite{but} states that engineers support the modern
society to function well by ensuring its fundamental facilities. 
The author demonstrates his thesis through three strands considering
infrastructure or the society, which are ``connect'', ``supply'' and
``protect''. 
By designing and building infrastructure, engineers influence the society on
various levels, from small family unit to the whole globe.
